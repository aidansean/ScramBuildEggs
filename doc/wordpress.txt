<h3>Overview</h3>

This is a script that parses the build log created by the CMSSW command "scram build" (hence the name!)  It takes the output, wraps it to a more readable width, splits errors by type and colours them, and also gives more useful output.  It's not complete yet, but it is already rather useful.
